Many schools:

3. Run both in parallel for testing
4. Switch when Power Apps is ready
5. Or keep both for different use cases

**Zero downtime, maximum flexibility!** ✨

## 🎉 CONCLUSION

**All three options will work for your VAPA department.**

The question is:
- Do you want it **now** (web app)
- Do you want to **learn** (Power Apps)
- Do you want **simple** (Forms)

My vote? **Start with the web app** → it's done, it works, it's free.
You can always build the M365 version later if needed.

**But you know your situation best** - choose what feels right! 👍
